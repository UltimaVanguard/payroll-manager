# payroll-manager

## Description

I am creating the payroll manager to allow people to enter the employees they have along with their salary. They will be able to see all of their employees displayed on the page and they will be able to go into the console to see the average salary of all their employees.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can access the website using https://ultimavanguard.github.io/payroll-manager/ this link.

When you click on the add employees button you are prompted to add an employee. You will get three prompts, one for first name, last name, and finally salary. Then you will get a prompt for if you want to add another. If you enter an invalid entry you will be prompted for the current prompt you were at. 

At the last prompt, clicking okay will let you add another employee and clicking cancel will display all the employees you entered in alphabetical order by last name.

If you go into the console you can see how many employees you have and their average salary. It will also pick out a random employee as the employee of the day.
